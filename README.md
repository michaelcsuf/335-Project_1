# Algorithm Analyzer Tool
This Python-based tool implements and analyzes five fundamental sorting and search algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Radix Sort, and Linear Search. It allows users to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of time complexity across different input sizes. The tool provides insights into how each algorithm behaves under varying conditions, making it ideal for educational purposes, performance benchmarking, and algorithm optimization.
